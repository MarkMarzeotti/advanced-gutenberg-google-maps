# Guten Google Maps

A Google Maps implementation for the WordPress Gutenberg block editor.

This started as a way to challenge myself in building a block for the WordPress block editor and because I could not find a Google Maps block with the level of customizability that I wanted.

## Features

I expect the feature list to grow as time goes on, but as of right now the following list outlines the Google Map features this block supports:

* Unlimited marker locations
* Unlimited style options
    * 6 standard style options
    * Use [Google's Styling Wizard](https://mapstyle.withgoogle.com/) to generate your own styles
* Simple map options for height, zoom, default UI, and scrolling
* Align as default, wide, and full-width

### Planned Features

* Info Boxes
* Custom Markers
